            <span class="black">This is the second item's accordion body.</span> It is hidden by default , until the collapse plugion adds the
            appropritae classes the we use to style each element.These classes control the overall appearance, as well
            as the showing and hiding via css transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our
            default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <span class="pink">.accordion-body</span>
            ,though the transition does limit overflow
